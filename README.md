# Kernighan_Ritchie_The_C_Programming_Language  
My work done while reading 1978 edition 1 'The C Programming Language'  
-Q: Why am I studying ANSI C?  
  -A: I am studying 1978 C for many reasons, despite the fact that my current plate of self-education is plenty-full already, with moving towards being an intermediate self-taught Python dev and aquiring my first job and title as such, with learning computer science the structure of data and algorithms, with learning the full stack of modern web development and delivery, CCNA coursework, electronics and engineering coursework, linear Algebra and frequency analysis and FFT, and calculus and it's quite-code-like nature of deriving integrals and comparing values otherwise unrelated or deatails which are hidden in noise. One (two) of the largest factor(s) is this need I have to place what I learn in context - historically, culturally, etc. See, my whole life I have had all the enthusiasm, passion, and more to truly delve into our field - I have always know it's what I wanted to do. But there was always a chasm between me and the reality of the technology and despite all of the excitment and effort no gains were ever made in fundemental understanding. It's strange and a little sad to reflect on, but I always knew deep down that if I couldn't describe, quantify, and conjecture upon the nature of a devices actual physical function then I would never attain the mastery that I sought even if it is umpteen layers of extraction above that fundemental, electrical and engineering level. Even still, I never stopped searching for answers.  
  With illuminated hindsight it's clear what and where the insurmountable obstacles of understanding were, but I don't find myself reflecting upon this frustrated and meandering path with dismay or dissapointment, as I am guilty of doing for a majority of my life. No. I'm honestly proud of the magnitude of that which I was able to accomplish and learn, in-spite of the fact that I knew I would never get where I wanted to go. I never stopped trying to learn it all and almost daily now it feels like I find an entire enclave-cluster of neurons that my younger self obstinantly errected in a dark and unfiendly forrest and I get to feel this novel and exstatic connectedness as I bulldoze into the strand of trees to reveal the path out and back to civilization.  
I did, in fact, have a 'Eureka!' moment that was my first chance in life, ever, to see the forest for the trees. My Eureka was early in 2022 when I conceptualized the number line in proportion for the first time. This occured simultaneously with me for the first time ever concieving of e and the irrational number plane. Later that day all of maths that had frustrated my ego and my learning disability my whole life first revealed themselves to me and at the same time gave me a framework for further Eureka.   
  Historical, almost role-playing-level contextualization of the original problems beings solved by a technology is the key to focusing the disperate and warring inclinations of my personality and epigenetics. The same day I first worked with e was the first time I ever historically concieved of trying to bridge the gap between maths (conception) and reality as a technology (rather than as something to be wrotley memorized in school?). I had been researching civilizations in the Lavant region (and other regions) as part of an extended geographical daydream brought on by modern day troubles and my paranoia about world war III and it was when reading about hamurabi's code and other primordeal governance systems that I first ever truly understood WHY trigonometry exists as a technology and what it is and why it is itself intrinsic to everything that came after. All of recorded history is nothing but triangles all the way down to the quantified and boundaried corner of the first marked pasture.

The rest of my stack is amdx64win11 hosting ubuntu20 using subsystem for linux. I'm using nano because i already learned dreamweaver 20 years ago and that IDE clearly didnt seem to help with actually learning to code. With the wisdom of time I now know that I actually just hate html and wish Python had already been decided as the new programmer's language when I came of age (gosh, I love python - another reason I'm learning C).
